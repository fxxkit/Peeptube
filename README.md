Feel too many search results and hate to open them one by one?
Peeptube provided some useful features called `Storyboard thumbnail`,  `Peep it` and `Small window view`. 
Once you have many videos to watch after searching, you can just put your mouse over the search results. 
The video storyboard frames will show in the thumbnail, you can see the storyboard snapshot about the video. 
By moving your mouse horizontally, the video storyboard will play on the video thumbnail.
